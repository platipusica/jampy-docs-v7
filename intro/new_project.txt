==================
Creating a project
==================

Create a new directory. 

Go into the directory and run from command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jam-project.py


The following files and folders will be created in the directory::

    /
        css/
        js/
        img/
        reports/
        static/
        admin.sqlite
        server.py
        index.html
        wsgi.py


To start the Jam.py web server, run the ``server.py`` script.


.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py


.. note::
    You can specify a port as parameter, for example 
    
    .. code-block:: console
    
        $ ./server.py 8081
        
    By default, the port is 8080. If you specify another port, you need to
    use it in your browser in the next steps.


Open a Web browser and go to “/builder.html” on your local domain – e.g.:

.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html
    
You should see the language selection dialog. This defines the language used for the
user interface. You can select the language from the list of default languages, or
import your own, using the "folder" icon to the right of the input field. See the
:doc:`Language support </admin/language_support>` page for more information.
Select your language and press the OK button.

Next is the new project dialog. Fill in:

* **Caption** - the project name that will appear to users.
* **Name** - the name of project (task) that will be used in the code (Python or JS)
  to get access to the task object. This should be a short and valid python identifier.
  This name is also used as a prefix when creating a table in the project database.
* **DB type** - select a database type. If the database is not Sqlite, it must be
  created in advance and its attributes should be entered in the 
  corresponding form fields. 
  To see examples of Database setup, follow the :doc:`link </admin/project/database>`.

When you press OK, the connection to the database will be checked, and in case 
of failure an error message will be displayed.


Examples of database setups
===========================

.. admonition:: Adapted from `Jam.py Design Tips`_

    Jam.py supports many different database servers. For example PostgreSQL_, MariaDB_, MySQL_, MSSQL_, Oracle_, Firebird_, IBM_, SQLite_ and SQLite with SQLCipher_.

    If you are developing a small project or something you don't plan to deploy in
    a production environment, SQLite is generally the best option as it doesn't
    require running a separate server. However, SQLite has many differences from
    other databases, so if you are working on something substantial, it's
    recommended to develop with the same database that you plan on using in
    production.


    In addition to a database backend, we need to make sure the Python
    database bindings are installed.

    * If using PostgreSQL, the ``psycopg2`` or ``psycopg2-binary`` package is needed. 
    * If using MySQL or MariaDB, the ``MySQLdb`` for Python 2.x is needed. For Python 3.x, the  ``mysql-connector-python`` and ``mysqlclient`` package is needed, as well as database client development files. 
    * If using MSSQL, the ``pymssql`` is needed.
    * If using Oracle, the `cx_Oracle`_ is needed, as well as Python headers (development files).
    * If using SQLCipher_,  ``sqlcipher3-binary`` package is needed for Linux. There is a standalone DLL for Windows available.
    * If using IBM_,  ``ibm_db`` and ``ibm_db_dbi`` package is needed.
    * If using Firebird,  ``fdb`` package is needed.
    * To generate reports, **LibreOffice** must be installed.

.. note::

    For a **SQLite** database, when an item field is deleted or renamed, or foreign
    key is created, the  
    :doc:`Application builder </admin/index>`
    creates a new table and copies records from the old one into it.
    
    For **SQLite** database, Jam.py doesn’t support importing of metadata into an 
    existing project (project with tables in the database). 
    You can only import metadata into a new project.

If all goes well, a new project will be created and the project tree will appear 
in the Application builder.

Now, to see the project itself, create a new page in the browser and type in the 
address bar:

.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080
