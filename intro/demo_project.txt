============
Demo project
============

The framework has a full-fledged demo application that demonstrates programming 
techniques used in the framework. 

The demo is located in the demo folder of the Jam.py package downloaded from Github. There is also a stand alone or an 
portable application for Windows x64 provided `here <https://github.com/platipusica/jampy-exe/releases/download/Pump/jampy_win_64.exe>`_.

The portable application depends on LibreOffice for Reports and nothing more. Just run it and point the browser as per below.

To start the demo application go to the demo folder and run *server.py* script.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py
