Form templates
==============

Form templates of the project are located in the 
:doc:`templates.html <templates_html>`
file. This file is located in the root directory of a project,
and accessed/modified by click on ``templates [F9]`` on :doc:`Task </admin/task>`  tree.

When 
:doc:`load </refs/client/task/m_load>` 
method is executed, the file is processed and stored in the
:doc:`templates </refs/client/task/at_templates>`
attribute as a JQuery object.

To add a form template for an item you should add a div with the ``name-suffix``
class in the templates div, where ``name`` is the 
:doc:`item_name </refs/client/abstr_item/at_item_name>`
of the item and ``suffix`` 
is the form type: view, edit, filter, param. 

For example:

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="invoices-edit">
		...
	</div>
	
is an edit form template of the **invoices** item. 

For a detail before its name there should be the name of its master, 
separated by a hyphen: 

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="invoices-invoice_table-edit">
		...
	</div>
	
If an item doesn't have a form template then the form template of its owner, if 
defined, will be used. 

So the template

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="journals-edit">
		...
	</div>

will be used to create edit forms of items that **Journals** group owns and that 
do not have its own edit form template. 

If, after searching this way, no template was found for an item, the template
with the ``default-suffix`` class will 
be used to create a form. 

So the template

.. code-block:: html

	<div class="default-edit">
		...
	</div>

will be used to create edit forms for items that have no templates defined for 
them and their owners.

When a new project is created the index.html already contains such templates.

Below is an example of default edit form template from index.html file:

.. code-block:: html

    <div class="default-edit">
        <div class="form-body">
            <div class="edit-body"></div>
            <div class="edit-detail"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="form-footer">
            <button type="button" id="ok-btn" class="btn btn-primary">
                <i class="bi bi-check-square"></i> OK<small class="muted">&nbsp;[Ctrl+Enter]</small>
            </button>
            <button type="button" id="cancel-btn" class="btn btn-secondary">
                <i class="bi bi-x-square"></i> Cancel
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>

There are more template examples in the
:doc:`Form examples <form_examples>`
section.
