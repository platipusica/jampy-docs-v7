Since Jam.py is Python and JavaScript language framework, valid Python and JavaScript identifiers 
should be used.
In addition, for all supported databases, their own valid identifiers should be used.

The file containing example list is ``keywords.py``, with below content:

.. code-block:: py

	keywords = [
		"BADGE",
		"LABEL",
		"HIDDEN",
		"PROGRESS",
		"TASK"
	]
