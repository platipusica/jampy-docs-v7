In this dialog project database parameters are displayed. When they have been 
changed and OK button is clicked, the Application builder will check connection 
to the database and if it failed to connect an error will be displayed.

.. note::
   When any **Database** parameter is changed, except **DB manual update**, 
   the server application must be restarted for changes to take effect.

If **DB manual update** checkbox is unchecked (default), then when changes to an 
item, that have an associated database table, are saved, this database table is 
automatically modified. For example, if we add a new field to some item in the
:doc:`Item Editor Dialog </admin/items/item_editor_dialog>`
, the new field will be added to the associated database table. If this checkbox 
is checked, no modifications to the database tables are made. 

The **DB manual update** was renamed to **DB manual mode** in more recent version.

.. note::
    Please be very careful when using this option.

Examples of database setups
===========================

.. admonition:: Adapted from `Jam.py Design Tips`_

    Jam.py supports many different database servers. For example PostgreSQL_, MariaDB_, MySQL_, MSSQL_, Oracle_, Firebird_, IBM_, SQLite_ and SQLite with SQLCipher_.

    If you are developing a small project or something you don't plan to deploy in
    a production environment, SQLite is generally the best option as it doesn't
    require running a separate server. However, SQLite has many differences from
    other databases, so if you are working on something substantial, it's
    recommended to develop with the same database that you plan on using in
    production.


    In addition to a database backend, we need to make sure the Python
    database bindings are installed.

    * If using PostgreSQL, the ``psycopg2`` or ``psycopg2-binary`` package is needed. 

    * If using MySQL or MariaDB, the ``MySQLdb`` for Python 2.x is needed. For Python 3.x, the  ``mysql-connector-python`` and ``mysqlclient`` package is needed, as well as database client development files. 

    * If using MSSQL, the ``pymssql`` is needed.

    * If using Oracle, the `cx_Oracle`_ is needed, as well as Python headers (development files).

    * If using SQLCipher_,  ``sqlcipher3-binary`` package is needed for Linux. There is a standalone DLL for Windows available.

    * If using IBM_,  ``ibm_db`` and ``ibm_db_dbi`` package is needed.

    * If using Firebird,  ``fdb`` package is needed.

Using MySQL on Windows is supported, please visit `MySQL deployment on Windows`_.

Even though Jam.py supports all databases from the above, there is no guarantee that some specific and/or propriety database functionality is supported. Here we name a few.
