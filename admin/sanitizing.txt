==========
Sanitizing
==========

To prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, Jam.py sanitizes field values 
displayed in the table columns.

For example, if field contains the following text:

.. code-block:: html

  <span style='color: red'>Norway</span>

when un-sanitized, it will be displayed in the table column as follows:

.. image:: /admin/_images/unsanitized_jampy.png
	:align: center
	:alt: unsanitized_jampy.png

When the field text is sanitized, it is transformed to the following:

.. code-block:: html

  "&lt;span style='color: red'&gt;Norway&lt;/span&gt;"

as you can see symbols '<' and '>' are replaced with '&lt;' and '&gt;'
and the table column will be displayed this way: 


.. image:: /admin/_images/sanitized_jampy.png
	:align: center
	:alt: sanitized_jampy.png

There are two ways to prevent sanitizing.

First is to set **Do not sanitize** attribute in the Interface tab in the 
:doc:`Field Editor Dialog </admin/items/field_editor_dialog>`

.. image:: /admin/_images/fields_editr_interface_jampy.png
	:align: center
	:alt: do_not_sanitize_jampy.png

Second is to write the 
:doc:`on_field_get_html </refs/client/item/on_field_get_html>`
event handler. If the this event handler returns a value it is not sanitized.
