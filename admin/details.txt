The Detail in Jam.py V7 is any database table linked in a way of Master/Details
relationship.
To group the database tables logically, we might use the Details Group
to "store" a detail of an item, as seen on below screenshot.


To work with a detail of an item, expand a group node that owns the item and 
select that item in the tree. In the center of the Application builder all 
details of this item will be displayed.

The right panel of the page have following buttons:

* **Client module** - click on this button to open the 
  :doc:`Code editor </admin/code_editor>`
  to edit client module of a detail, see 
  :doc:`Working with modules </programming/modules>`.

* **Server module**	- click on this button to open the 
  :doc:`Code editor </admin/code_editor>`
  to edit server module of a detail, see 
  :doc:`Working with modules </programming/modules>`.

* **View Form** - use this button to invoke the 
  :doc:`View Form Dialog <items/view_form_dialog>`
  to set the fields to be displayed in tables on the client and their order, 
  by default. See 
  :doc:`create_table </refs/client/item/m_create_table>` 
  method

* **Edit Form** -  use this button to invoke the 
  :doc:`Edit Form Dialog <items/edit_form_dialog>`
  to set the fields to be displayed in edit forms on the client and their 
  order, by default. See 
  :doc:`create_inputs </refs/client/item/m_create_inputs>`
  method.

* **Filters** - use this button to invoke the
  :doc:`Filters Dialog <filters_dialog>`
  to create, modify and delete item filters. See
  :doc:`Filters </programming/data/filters>`.

* **Details** - use this button to invoke the
  :doc:`Details Dialog <details_dialog>`
  to add or remove details linked to the item.

* **Order** - use this button to invoke the
  :doc:`Order Dialog <order_dialog>`
  to specify how records will be ordered by default. See
  :doc:`open </refs/client/item/m_open>`
  method

* **Indices** - сlick this button to open the
  :doc:`Indices Dialog <indices_dialog>`
  to create and delete indices for the item database table.

..
    * **Foreign keys** - сlick this button to open the
      :doc:`Foreign Keys Dialog <foreign_keys_dialog>`
      to create foreign keys for the database table.

* **Reports** - сlick this button to open the
  :doc:`Reports Dialog <reports_dialog>`
  to specify reports that could printed for the item. 
  A new project has a function that can be used to create a drop-up 
  button to print the reports.
  
* **Privileges** - click this button to open a dialog to configure the 
  privileges assigned to user roles for this item.
  
Use **Edit** button at the bottom of the page to change ``item_name`` or 
``caption`` of a `detail`.
