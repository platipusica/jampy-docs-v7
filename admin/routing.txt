Routing
========


The Jam.py v7 introduced routing. As Jam.py v5 is a SPA (Single Page Application), there was no need for routing.
On the other hand, there was a need to implement, for example, the User registration page with Jam.py v5.	

The solution for this problem was similar to :doc:`creating a registration form </how_to/authentication/how_to_create_registration_form>`.

As seen, the **register.html** file is using JavaScript AJAX code. Hence, any additional page would need a similar approach, if
interacting with the database.

In Jam.py v7, the solution is processing every request in the on_request event handler and defining a response on a valid request.

This enables us to do custom login and registration forms, where custom errors can be created. For example: "User does not exist!", "Wrong password", etc.

The new **login.html** page:


.. image:: /admin/_images/custom_login_error.png
	:align: center
	:alt: Custom Login Form


The new **register.html** page (no AJAX):

.. image:: /admin/_images/register_form_v7.png
	:align: center
	:alt: Registration Form


Routing code
=============


As mentioned, the ``on_request`` is used (no Python logic shown below to make it simple to read).

The below code should exist on "Task/Server Module":

.. code-block:: Python

	def on_request(task, request):
		parts = request.path.strip('/').split('/')
		if not parts[0]:
		    if task.logged_in(request):
		        return task.serve_page('index.html')
		    else:
		        return task.redirect('/login.html')
		elif parts[0] == 'login.html':
					.
					.
		            return task.serve_page(login_path, login_params)
					.
					.

		elif parts[0] == 'register.html':
					.
					.
		            return task.serve_page('register.html', 
					.
					.

		            return task.redirect('/login.html')
