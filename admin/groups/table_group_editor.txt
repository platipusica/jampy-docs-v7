===================
Detail Group Editor
===================

**Detail Group Editor** opens when a developer wants to create a new detail group 
or modify an existing one. See 
:doc:`Task tree </programming/task_tree>`

The upper part of the **Detail Group Editor** have the following fields:

* **Caption** - the item name that appears to users.

* **Name** - the name of the item that will be used in programming code to 
  get access to the item object. It should be unique in the project and should 
  be a valid python identifier.

* **Table** - the name of the table that will be created in the project 
  database. This name is specified when creating an item, and can not be 
  changed later.
  
* **Primary key field** - by clicking on the button to the right of this 
  attribute you can specify the primary key field for the item. If the primary 
  key field was defined for the group that owns the item it will be displayed 
  there by default, otherwise you have to create this field first.

* **Deleted flag field** - by clicking on the button to the right of this 
  attribute you can specify the field that will serve as a deleted flag 
  for the item. If the deleted flag field was defined for the group that owns 
  the item it will be displayed there by default, otherwise you have to create 
  this field first.

* **Visible** - use this checkbox to set item's visible attribute. The value of 
  this attribute can be used in code on the client to create menu items and so 
  on.

* **Soft delete** - when this check-box is checked, the delete method does not 
  erase a record physically from the table, but uses this field to mark the 
  record as deleted. See
  :doc:`Common fields </programming/data/common_fields>`,
  :doc:`delete </refs/server/item/m_delete>`
  method (server),
  :doc:`delete </refs/client/item/m_delete>`
  method (client).
  
* **Virtual table** - if this checkbox is checked, no database table will be 
  created. Use this options to create an item with in-memory dataset or to use 
  its modules to write code.
  This checkbox must be set when creating an item and can not be changed 
  later.
  
* **History** - if this checkbox is checked, the application will saving for this
  item audit trail/change history made by users, see 
  :doc:`Saving audit trail/change history made by users </admin/saving_history>`

* **Edit lock** - if this checkbox is checked, the application will use record 
  locking while users concurrently edit a record, see
  :doc:`Record locking </admin/record_locking>`
  
  
In the center part of the **Detail Group Editor** dialog there is a table 
containing a list of fields, defined for the item. These fields are 
:doc:`common </programming/data/common_fields>`
to all items the group will own. 

To add, modify or delete a field use the following buttons:

* **New** - click this button to invoke the 
  :doc:`Field Editor Dialog </admin/items/field_editor_dialog>`
  to create a new field.

* **Edit** - click this button to invoke the 
  :doc:`Field Editor Dialog </admin/items/field_editor_dialog>`
  to modify a selected field.

* **Delete** - click the button to delete a field selected in in the field list.

In the bottom-right corner of the Dialog form there are two buttons:

* **OK** - click the button to save change you made. 

* **Cancel** - click the buttons to cancel the operation.

.. note::
    You can create new or modify existing fields and set **Primary key field**, 
    **Deleted flag field** and **Master ID field**, **Master record id field** 
    attributes only when creating a new group or editing an empty one.
    
    For existing detail groups, that already own items you can only change 
    **Caption**, **Name** and  **Visible** attributes.
