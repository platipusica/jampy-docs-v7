How to migrate v5 project to v7
==================================


#. The biggest obstacle to move a Jam.py v5 application is the "Edit Lock" enabled on the table(s). The Jam.py v7 is expecting a  `record_version` (INT) field for every table with the Edit Lock.

   There are two options when migrating to V7. One is to disable the "Edit Lock" before migration, and the second option is to add the `record_version` field to affected tables before the migration. 

   After the field is added to the database structure, we need to add it to the Application Builder manually, with "DB Manual Mode" turned ON for every table with "Edit Lock" enabled. The "record version" option should be set with `record_version` field.

   Obviously, disabling the "Edit Lock" does not need anything.

#. The next issue is templates. The Jam.py v7 is expecting the template.html file within the application folder. Due to Bootstrap 5 usage, some minor differences will arise with moving the existing templates from Jam.py v5 index.html file to template.html file.
