How to migrate v5 project to v7
==================================


#. The biggest obstacle to move a Jam.py v5 application is the "Edit Lock" (record locking), enabled on the table(s). The Jam.py v7 is expecting a  `record_version` (INT) field for every table with the Edit Lock.

   There are two options when migrating to V7. One is to disable the "Edit Lock" before migration, and the second option is to add the `record_version` field to affected tables before the migration. 

   After the field is added to the database structure, we need to add it to the Application Builder manually, with "DB Manual Mode" turned ON for every table with "Edit Lock" enabled. The "record version" option should be set with `record_version` field.

   Obviously, disabling the "Edit Lock" does not need anything. There is no option on project Parameters to create the "Lock Item".

#. The next issue is templates. The Jam.py v7 is expecting the template.html file within the application folder. Due to Bootstrap 5 usage, some minor differences will arise with moving the existing templates from Jam.py v5 index.html file to template.html file.

#. Foreign Key support is dropped at v7. This means if there are any Foreign Keys created at V5, there will be no option to manage it at v7.


#. The Jam.py V7 introduced the calculated field. It is now possible to use the server side functions (SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG), for the lookup to a table field in a Master/Detail scenario. The Users might review the server side calculations code and replace it with a calculated fields, if appropriate.


#. Jam.py V7 is now utilising the Python dependencies and will automatically install needed libraries with the initial install. This is different to v5, where all dependencies were "locked in" with the Jam.py distribution, enabling a single ``jam`` folder for deployment with the application.


#. For applications with Jam.py version 5.x or below, replace the Task/Client module code with Task/Client module code from Demo application or the new v7 project. Than, add a custom the code from v5 Task/Client module, if there was any.
